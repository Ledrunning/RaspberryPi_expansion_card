# RaspberryPi expansion card;
## Schematic circuit and PCB;
## Two scripts written on Python for ADC MCP3008 and DS18B20 temperature sensor;
## Prototyping board project for Raspberry Pi B+, Raspberry Pi II, Raspberry Pi 3;

The Prototyping board included:

1. Real-time clock;

2. 10-bit ADC with SPI interface;

3. RS485 hardware bus;

4. Two 5A, 220V Relays;

5. Two common collector outputs;

6. 220V, 50Hz power supply;

7. 4 buttons;


* In the BOM folder you can find a bill of all materials needed to make this board;

* In the Design folder you can find circuit design and PCB design files; In order to open these files, 
* you should use the Dip Trace 3.0 CAD or other CAD viewers;

* Test source codes located in the Source folder;

* You should configure your Raspbian using the tutorial and commands in Settings.txt;
